# Advent of Code 2020

I have finally decided to take part in [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2020). This repository contains my probably-not-the-best solutions to given problems, but hey, at least they do their jobs!

Technologies used: C#, .NET Core 3.1

## Running the solutions

First clone the repository using

```
git clone https://github.com/mddr/advent-of-code-2020.git
```
Then go to the folder containing solution you want to try, e.g. for day 1:

```
cd "day 1"
```
And, finally, use
```
dotnet run
```

Please note, that you probably need to have .NET CLI installed.
